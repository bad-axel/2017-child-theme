				 <p>I’m a curriculum designer at  Teach Think Elementary,  as well as a digital nomad and <del>future</del> WordPress developer.
					 <br>
					 <br>I got my start as a teacher in New York City public schools, and learned and worked my way into running my own online businesses.
					 <br>
					 <br>When I’m not out wandering the globe (which is most of the time), I can usually be found on the ice (skating!),
					 attempting to learn languages, devouring whatever street food I can find, building human towers, or doing whatever it is the locals do.</p>
